A TypeScript Finite State Machine library.

## Example

First create an enum with the states and possible actions on those states.
It can have text values:

```typescript
const enum GhostStates {
  Waiting = 'Waiting',
  Chasing = 'Chasing',
  Scatter = 'Scatter',
  Frightened = 'Frightened',
  Eaten = 'Eaten',
  Paused = 'Paused',
}

const enum GhostActions {
  Wait = 'Wait',
  Chase = 'Chase',
  Scatter = 'Scatter',
  Frighten = 'Frighten',
  Eat = 'Eat',
  Pause = 'Pause',
}
```

or just a plain numeric enum:

```typescript
const enum GhostStates {
  Waiting,
  Chasing,
  Scatter,
  Frightened,
  Eaten,
  Paused,
}

const enum GhostActions {
  Wait,
  Chase,
  Scatter,
  Frighten,
  Eat,
  Pause,
}
```

To create the typed finite state machine use the following code with the previously defined enum and the start/default state of the machine as a parameter.

```typescript
const ghostState = new Typed.FSM<GhostStates>(GhostStates.Waiting);
```
To create states/transitions we first call the `from()` method on the `ghostState` object, this will create a state of `Waiting`.
To add a transition rule to this state we can chain the `to()` method to this call and give it the state `Chasing`.
This will allow us to go from `Waiting` to `Chasing` but not from `Chasing` to `Waiting`.
Next we call the `toFrom()` method which will create a transition rule to allow us to change from `Waiting` to `Paused` and from `Paused` back to `Waiting`.

```typescript
ghostState
  .from(GhostStates.Waiting, GhostActions.Wait)
    .to(GhostStates.Chasing, GhostActions.Chase)
    .to(GhostStates.Scatter, GhostActions.Scatter)
    .toFrom(GhostStates.Paused, GhostActions.Pause);
```

To change the state of the finite state machine we can either specify the new state to change to:

```typescript
ghostState.change(GhostStates.Chasing);
```

Or tell it an action to perform:

```typescript
ghostState.do(GhostActions.Chase);
```
